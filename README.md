# CS-465-Final-Project
Spring 2017 Final Project - Computer Graphics


Run in Visual Studio.
If 2015 or greater, add legacy_stdio_definitions.lib; to Project Properties/Linker/Input/Additional Dependencies

Include Glee.c, gltools.cpp, and math3d.cpp along with the main .cpp file.


There seems to be an issue where the ground disappears while moving, however, this only seems to occur on certain devices/configurations. I am unsure as to whether this is due to using a newer version of visual studio, or if the current device's GPU doesnt like it. This project is finished, so I do not intend on looking into it further.
